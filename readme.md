# React Frontend Microservices with Webpack a bit optimized
## Description
There are five applications running in this frontend microservices project. Each application is a separate microservice that is responsible for a specific task. The applications are:
1. **MF_Server**: This application is responsible for serving the frontend to the user. It is a Node.js application that uses Express.js to serve the movie data to frontend. Running on port 5555.
2. **MovieApp**: Main application that handles routes and state management.
3. **ReactComponents**: Contains all the React components that are used in the MovieApp.
4. **HomePage**: Contains the homepage of the application.
5. **DetailsPage**: Contains the details page of the application.
6. **SeatSelection**: Contains the seat selection page of the application.
## Notes
- The project is a bit optimized. The project is optimized by using Webpack to bundle the React components and the CSS files. The project is also optimized by using the React.lazy() function to load the components only when they are needed.
